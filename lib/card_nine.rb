# CardNine is a programmers toolkit providing abstractions for cards, decks, dealers, and
#   hands.  It also provides a pair of sample games that use the system.
#   A Card is the base unit and can be as simple as a name, slightly more complicated like
#   a playing card with ranks, suits and sorting.  Attributes and keyword lists will make even
#   the most complicated
